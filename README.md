# HousePricePrediction
Applying Regression machine learning models to predict sale prices of hundreds of residential real estate properties in the Ames, Iowa, area. Using the learned relationships between features of each property (square footage, year built, overall condition/quality, pool area, etc.) and the final sale price of that property, the regression models can evaluate and predict the final sale price of the property based on sensitivity to features that correlate highly with sale prices.
